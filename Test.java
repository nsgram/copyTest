If your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is not accepting requests larger than 1MB, the issue is likely due to one of the following factors:

1. Ingress Controller Limits

If you are using NGINX Ingress Controller, it has a default request body size limit of 1MB. You can increase it by adding the following annotation to your Ingress resource:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "50m"
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myapp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80

ðŸ”¹ Change "50m" to your desired size, such as "100m" for 100MB.

After updating the Ingress resource, restart the NGINX controller:

kubectl rollout restart deployment nginx-ingress-controller -n kube-system

2. AKS Load Balancer Limit

If you are using the Azure Application Gateway as an Ingress Controller, you need to update the request-body-size limit in the ConfigMap:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: appgw-ingress-config
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  request-body-size: "50m"

After updating, restart the Application Gateway Ingress Controller:

kubectl delete pod -n kube-system -l app=ingress-azure

3. NGINX Configuration Inside AKS Pods

If your application is running inside an NGINX-based container, modify nginx.conf:

http {
    client_max_body_size 50M;
}

Then restart your pods:

kubectl rollout restart deployment my-deployment

4. API Gateway (APIM) Limitations

If your request goes through Azure API Management (APIM) before reaching AKS, ensure the content-length limit is configured in Azure API Management policies:

<inbound>
    <base />
    <set-header name="Content-Length" exists-action="override">
        <value>52428800</value> <!-- 50MB -->
    </set-header>
</inbound>

5. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules

If AKS is behind Azure WAF, update the WAF policy:
	1.	Go to Azure Portal â†’ WAF Policy
	2.	Increase the Max Request Body Size (default is 128 KB)
	3.	Save changes and restart your Ingress Controller or Application Gateway

6. Check Your Application Code

If the API itself enforces a max request size, increase the limit in Spring Boot:

For Spring Boot WebFlux:

spring.codec.max-in-memory-size=50MB
server.tomcat.max-swallow-size=50MB

Final Steps

âœ… After making these changes, restart your AKS pods and test the upload again.

kubectl delete pod --all -n my-namespace

This should resolve the 1MB request size limitation in AKS. Let me know if you need more details!
